//! Prepares the grid's pictures in the background, so that scrolling a library never waits on a
//! resize: after each scan or metadata refresh (and once at startup), every item's Primary image
//! gets its grid master (`image_proxy::GRID_MASTER`, the copy smaller grid copies are made from)
//! and its BlurHash, where it has none yet. Remote originals are kept in the data dir as the
//! image route does on first use.
//!
//! It renders in the background lane (`image_proxy::RenderFor::Background`): one picture at a
//! time, only while no client render runs, and never queued for memory ahead of a client.
//!
//! Masters are written only while the whole disk image cache stays under `WARM_SHARE` of its cap,
//! counting the copies already there, so a pass never pushes the cache to its sweep and never
//! evicts what clients (or an earlier pass) stored. A library too large for that warms its top
//! part; its other pictures still get a BlurHash when their original is on disk already.
//! A picture that fails is not tried again until the server restarts.
